### I have used React, styled components, MUI Loader component, with Typescript 

- I have followed Component Driven Developemnt, where i have separated the most important components.

- All the three cases has been handled, such as :
   - Initial page before the data has been fetched.
   - While the Data fetching is going on.
   - When the data has been fetched and rendered to the user.
- Axios has been used to fetch data, I have used useState hook to keep track of the user data coming from API and the loading state.
- I have made it responsive to the various screens, using media queries.
- All the styling has been done using styled components.
